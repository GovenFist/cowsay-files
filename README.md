cowsay-files
============

These files are intended to supplement the cow files in /usr/share/cowsay/cows.

    echo Exterminate! | cowsay -f dalek

## examples

[A sample of each cow file in this repository is here](examples.md). Note that the ANSI cows like [bender.cow](https://github.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/blob/master/cows/bender.cow) will only render properly if your terminal client supports full color.
